    "  <p>This problem occcured during when I was working on creating colored buttons for my index.md home page I was trying to create a liverpool.md button that links to the page but it wasnt working. I was getting errors and to fix it I realized I had to add a slash in the end of the div so I added a slash. Another problem was that the file path to the liverpool.md had to be in html to fix it so I did that. Below is the fixed code which works. I used my debugging, researching, and teamwork skills to fix this problem</p>\n",
